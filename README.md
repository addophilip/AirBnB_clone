What to expect
Airbnb clone is a web-based platform that replicates the functionality and features of the popular online marketplace for short-term home rentals, Airbnb.
A command interpreter is a tool that provides a command line interface for interacting with a system or application.
To start a command interpreter for an Airbnb clone project, you would typically need to open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the command interpreter executable file.
To use the command interpreter, you would enter various commands to perform various operations. For example, you may enter commands to create new listings, manage bookings, and view statistics.
Here are a few examples of commands you might use in a command interpreter for an Airbnb clone project:
-create: Creates a new listing, taking parameters such as the listing name, address, and rental price.
-list: Displays a list of all listings, along with their basic details.
-book: Books a specific listing for a certain period, taking parameters such as the listing name, dates, and number of guests.
